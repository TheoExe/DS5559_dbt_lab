# DS5559_dbt_lab
Lab exploring DBT and connection to Snowflake. 

By storing the access credentials locally in the profiles.yml file and running the db build command while in the first_project directory, the user is able to create a database in Snowflake and run tests on it.

The user has to be configured in Snowflake to have DB Create privileges and assigned the correct role or else this method will not work.
